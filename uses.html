                            1980s. Still a favorite among professionals, SLA 3D printers utilize a laser to harden
                            liquid resin into plastic via photopolymerization. It's a process that has stood the test of
                            time for creating precise, high-quality objects.</th>

                        <th>Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) 3D printers leverage high-power lasers to sinter tiny
                            polymer powder particles into a solid form. The unfused powder acts as a support during the
                            process, eliminating the need for separate support structures. This makes SLS perfect for
                            creating complex geometries like interior features, undercuts, thin walls, and negative
                            features. The resulting parts boast impressive mechanical properties, similar in strength to
                            injection-molded pieces.</th>

                        <th>Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), or Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), is the go-to 3D
                            printing method for most consumers. These printers extrude thermoplastic filaments like ABS
                            or PLA through a heated nozzle, melting the material and then building up the object layer
                            by layer on a platform. Each layer is meticulously laid down until the whole part is formed.
                            Simple but effective!</th>

                        <th>DLP boasts faster print times than SLA because it exposes each layer simultaneously, rather
                            than tracing the cross-section of an area with a laser. Common uses for both SLA and DLP
                            include creating injection mold-type polymer models, jewelry, dental applications, and
                            hearing aids. They excel in producing fine details and smooth surface finishes. However,
                            their brittleness makes them unsuitable for mechanical parts.</th>

                        <th>Multi Jet Fusion (MJF) builds functional parts from nylon powder. Instead of using a laser
                            to sinter the powder, MJF utilizes an inkjet array to apply fusing agents to the nylon
                            powder bed. A heating element then passes over the bed to fuse each layer, resulting in more
                            consistent mechanical properties and improved surface finish compared to SLS. Another perk
                            of the MJF process is the accelerated build time, leading to lower production costs.</th>

                        <th>PolyJet printing does have a bit of a twist. It allows for the creation of parts with
                            varying properties, such as different colors and materials. Designers often use this tech
                            for prototyping elastomeric or over-molded parts. Itâ€™s quite the versatile tool for detailed
                            and multi-material designs!</th>
